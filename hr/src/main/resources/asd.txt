Add the necessary dependencies to the pom file of the hr application to use Spring MVC and Thymeleaf

Develop a web page using Spring MVC and Thymeleaf which enables creating an Employee,
and listing all employees in a tabular form:

Use the existing Employee class
The employees should be stored only in memory


Write an EmployeeDto class in the dto subpackage, which contains the same fields and getters/setters as the Employee class

Implement a JSON based REST API with the /api/employees base URI, with endpoints capable of:
    Listing all employees
    Return on employee with a given id
    Adding a new employee
    Modifying an existing employee
    Deleting an existing employee
    Listing employees with salary higher than a given value passed as query parameter

The employees should be stored only in memory for the RESTS API as well
Test this REST API with Postman
